<a name="label21"></a><h4 class="jdocu">-E, -expire &lt;time&gt; (advanced)</h4 class="jdocu">

                  
                  Check out licenses with an expire time, for off-line use.
                  Valid formats are:
                  <ul>
                  <li>dd-mmm-yyyy[:hh:mm] &#8211; where:

                  <li>+&lt;num&gt;h &#8211; setting the license to expire
                  &lt;num&gt; hours from now.</li>
                  <li>+&lt;num&gt;d &#8211; setting the license to expire

          Add a path to the directory list that Simics searches for modules.
          <a name="label23"></a><h4 class="jdocu">-batch-mode (advanced)</h4 class="jdocu">

          
          Run in batch mode. This means that Simics will exit when all commands
          and scripts given on the command line have executed, or as soon as an
          error occurs.
<p>
          When an error has occurred, Simics will immediately exit with a
          non-zero status. If all commands run to completion, Simics exits with
          status 0, indicating success.
<p>
          Simics will not use the command history file in batch mode.
          <a name="label24"></a><h4 class="jdocu">-c &lt;file&gt;</h4 class="jdocu">

                           
                           Load a configuration file. This is equivalent to
                           issuing a <b>read-configuration</b> command
                           after Simics has started.
<p>
                           If this flag is the last on the command line,
                           <tt>-c</tt> may be omitted.
<p>
                           <a name="label25"></a><h4 class="jdocu">-central &lt;address[:port]&gt;</h4 class="jdocu">

          
<p>
          Connect to Simics Central.  Simics Central may be running on another
          host, and this argument to this flag is an IP address and an optional
          port number where Simics Central is listening.  The port number
          defaults to 1909 if omitted.
<p>
          If the local hosts' address is supplied, and the port number is left
          out, Simics will try to connect to the default Unix file socket
          (<tt>/tmp/simics-central</tt>).
<p>
          Also see the <tt>-central :&lt;file&gt;</tt> flag.
          <a name="label26"></a><h4 class="jdocu">-central :&lt;file&gt;</h4 class="jdocu">

          
          Connect to Simics Central using a Unix file socket. This variant of
          the <tt>-central</tt> flag lets you specify a socket file.
          <a name="label27"></a><h4 class="jdocu">-central-time-out &lt;time&gt;</h4 class="jdocu">

          
          Simics will wait <i>time</i> seconds trying to connect to a central
          server every second before giving up and starting without the central
          connection.
          <a name="label28"></a><h4 class="jdocu">-dstc (advanced)</h4 class="jdocu">

                  
                  Force the D-STC to be enabled. See the <tt>-no-stc</tt> flag

                  <a name="label29"></a><h4 class="jdocu">-e &lt;command&gt;</h4 class="jdocu">

                          
                          Execute a CLI command. Equivalent of typing in the
                          command at the command line prompt.
                          <a name="label30"></a><h4 class="jdocu">-echo</h4 class="jdocu">

                          
                          Enable command echoing.  When echoing is enabled,
                          Simics will echo all commands executed by startup
                          scripts. Note that this only affects any startup
                          scripts loaded after the <tt>-echo</tt> flag on the
                          command line.
                          <a name="label31"></a><h4 class="jdocu">-fast</h4 class="jdocu">

          
<p>
          For backwards compatibility only. "Fast" mode is the default mode of
          execution.
          <a name="label32"></a><h4 class="jdocu">-h</h4 class="jdocu">

                  
                  Makes Simics print a brief help screen and exit.

                  Force the I-STC to be enabled. See the <tt>-no-stc</tt> flag
                  for more information.
                  <a name="label34"></a><h4 class="jdocu">-license</h4 class="jdocu">

                  
                  Print the Simics license text and exit.  This is the default
                  license and is also included in the <tt>LICENSE</tt> file.
                  <a name="label35"></a><h4 class="jdocu">-license-file &lt;file&gt; (advanced)</h4 class="jdocu">

          
          Specify the FLEXlm license file to use.  This will make Simics ignore
          the <tt>VTECH_LICENSE_FILE</tt> and <tt>LM_LICENSE_FILE</tt>
          environment variables. On Unix systems the
          <tt>$HOME/.flexlmlc</tt> file is ignored, as well as the Registry
          on Windows hosts. The <tt>$HOME/.flexlmrc</tt>, and the Registry
          are not updated when Simics is started with this flag.
          <a name="label36"></a><h4 class="jdocu">-log-file &lt;file&gt;</h4 class="jdocu">

                  
                  Use a different log file than the default
                  <tt>.simics-log</tt>.

<p>
          Start micro-architect version of Simics if available. For more
          information about the micro-architect version, see the <em>Simics
          User Guide</em>. If you use this option, you typically want to run
          a micro-architect specific configuration and/or script as well.
          <a name="label38"></a><h4 class="jdocu">-n</h4 class="jdocu">

                  
                  Do not run the commands from the
                  <tt>startup-commands</tt> script files.
                  <a name="label39"></a><h4 class="jdocu">-no-copyright (advanced)</h4 class="jdocu">

                  
                  Do not print out copyright notices when starting Simics. See
                  also the <tt>-verbose</tt> and <tt>-quiet</tt> flags.
                  <a name="label40"></a><h4 class="jdocu">-no-dstc (advanced)</h4 class="jdocu">

                  
                  Force the D-STC to be disabled. See the <tt>-no-stc</tt> flag
                  for more information.
                  <a name="label41"></a><h4 class="jdocu">-no-istc (advanced)</h4 class="jdocu">

                  
                  Force the I-STC to be disabled. See the <tt>-no-stc</tt> flag
                  for more information.
                  <a name="label42"></a><h4 class="jdocu">-no-log</h4 class="jdocu">

          
          Turns off logging to <tt>.simics-log</tt> (or any other file
          specified by <tt>-log-file</tt>).
          <a name="label43"></a><h4 class="jdocu">-no-stc (advanced)</h4 class="jdocu">

                  
<p>
                  Disable the Simics internal caches for memory operations and
                  instruction fetches (STC:s) that Simics uses to speed up the
                  simulation.
<p>
                  Disabling the STC:s (this flag disables both the D-STC and
                  the I-STC) can be useful for debugging plug-ins such as cache
                  models, since it will ensure that all memory accesses are
                  fully visible.
<p>
                  It is possible to selectively disable the data and
                  instruction STC:s using the <tt>-no-dstc</tt> and
                  <tt>-no-istc</tt> flags, respectively.  The STC:s are
                  typically enabled by default, although in some versions of
                  Simics they may be disabled. See also the <tt>-stc</tt> flag.
                  <a name="label44"></a><h4 class="jdocu">-no-use-cygpath (advanced)</h4 class="jdocu">

                  
<p>
                  Disable Cygwin path translation.  with this option set,
                  Simics will not be able to load files specified with Cygwin
                  syntax, or to follow symlinks created by Cygwin. Windows host
                  only.
                  <a name="label45"></a><h4 class="jdocu">-no-win</h4 class="jdocu">

                  
<p>
                  Disable external windows.  This will prevent Simics from
                  opening target console windows or any other external windows.
<p>
                  Disabling a target console only makes it invisible. It does
                  not change its simulated functionality. Disabling it is
                  useful when running in batch mode or when the target console
                  isn't needed, since it doesn't require access to a graphical
                  environment, and running with windows disabled is usually
                  somewhat faster.
<p>
                  <a name="label46"></a><h4 class="jdocu">-obscure</h4 class="jdocu">

          Specify the licensed product to use. The chosen product specifies
          which models and capabilities you can use with Simics.

           <p>
           Make Simics less verbose. This makes Simics output less information,
           which is useful for batch execution. The opposite effect can be
           obtained with the <tt>-verbose</tt> flag. The quiet and verbose
           flags turn off each other. If you want Simics to be really quiet you
           can also give the <tt>-no-copyright</tt> flag.
           <p>
           Note that Simics is rather quiet by default, so this flag usually
           doesn't do all that much.
           <a name="label50"></a><h4 class="jdocu">-readme</h4 class="jdocu">

                  
                  Print the Simics <tt>README</tt>

                  <a name="label51"></a><h4 class="jdocu">-stall</h4 class="jdocu">

          
          Start the stall version of Simics if available. For more information
          about this version and its limitations, see the <em>Simics User
          Guide</em>.
          <a name="label52"></a><h4 class="jdocu">-stc (advanced)</h4 class="jdocu">

                  
                  Force the I-STC and D-STC to be enabled (default). See the
                  <tt>-no-stc</tt> flag for more information. The STC:s are
                  typically enabled by default, although in some versions of
                  Simics they may be disabled.
                  <a name="label53"></a><h4 class="jdocu">-use-cygpath (advanced)</h4 class="jdocu">

                  
<p>
                  Enable Cygwin path translation. This is the default, and
                  enables Simics to understand Cygwin paths ("/cygdrive/c/",
                  for example), and translate them into native Windows form
                  (C:\).
<p>
                  The translation is done internally, and behaves similar to
                  the Cygwin <tt>cygpath</tt> utility. See the documentation
                  for the SIM_native_path() API call for further details.

                  Print the Simics version number and exit. Other information
                  printed include the compilers used and the compile-time
                  options applied to this specific build. <tt>-v-short</tt>
                  only prints out Simics version.

          Make Simics more verbose. This makes Simics give ample details about
          the execution. This is the opposite of the <tt>-quiet</tt> flag. The
          quiet and verbose flags turn off each other. The default is somewhere
          in the middle with a "reasonable" output level.
<p>
          Setting the verbose flag can be useful to figure out problems that
          you may be having with Simics. Some friendly warnings are not printed
          unless verbose is turned on.
<p>
          Note that there will be quite a bit of information printed, most of
          which isn't usually needed.
          <a name="label56"></a><h4 class="jdocu">-werror (advanced)</h4 class="jdocu">
