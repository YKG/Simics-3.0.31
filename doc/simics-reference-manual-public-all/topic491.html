   Most functions in the interface get the <i>object</i> and the
   <i>bp</i> arguments as in-parameters. Object is the object
   implementing this interface and bp is a structure that is used to
   identify the breakpoint. bp is of type <b>breakpoint_t</b> and is
   declared like this:

   </span>
<p>
   <b>insert_breakpoint</b> are called when a breakpoint is added on
   the object. This can be done with the break command or with
   the SIM_breakpoint API function.
   <p>
   <b>remove_breakpoint</b> should remove the breakpoint and further
   accesses to the address range should not stop the simulation.
<p>
   <b>remove_breakpoint_range</b> is called when a range should be
   removed from a breakpoint. It is thus possible to create holes in
   the range. See SIM_breakpoint_remove. <i>access</i> is what kind of
   accesses should be removed. See SIM_breakpoint for a description of
   the access parameter.
<p>
   <b>get_breakpoint_ranges</b> should return a list of ranges
   currently set.  <tt><a name="label17711">breakpoint_range_t</a></tt> is
   declared like this:
   <p>

        generic_address_t          upper;
        struct breakpoint_range   *next;
};</pre>

<p>
   <b>get_breakpoints</b> should return a vector of breakpoints set on
   the object matching <i>access</i> and <i>type</i>. See
   SIM_breakpoint for a description of access and type.
   <b>breakpoint_vector_t</b> is declared like this:

<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">typedef struct {

Add breakpoint (read, write, or execute) on an object implementing the
breakpoint interface. This is typically a memory space object such as
physical memory; e.g., <b>phys_mem0.break 0xff3800</b>. Accesses
intersecting the given range will trigger the breakpoint. By default
the breakpoint will only trigger for instruction execution, but any
subset of read, write, and execute accesses can be set to trigger
using combinations of <i>-r</i>, <i>-w</i>, and <i>-x</i>.
<p>
<i>length</i> is the interval length in bytes (default is 1).
<p>
Breakpoints inserted with the <b>tbreak</b> command are
automatically disabled when they have triggered.
<p>
The default action at a triggered breakpoint is to return to the
frontend. This can be changed by using haps. When an execution
breakpoint is triggered, Simics will return to the command prompt
before the instructions is executed, while instructions triggering
read or write breakpoints will complete before control is returned to
the command prompt.
<p>
To break on a virtual address, use a context object:
<p>
<b>primary_context.break 0x1ff00</b>
<p>
Several breakpoints can be set on the same address and Simics will
break on them in turn. If hap handlers (callback functions) are
connected to the breakpoints they will also be executed in turn. Hap
handlers are called before the access is performed, allowing the user
to read a memory value that may be overwritten by the access. See the
Simics Reference Manual for a description of hap handlers.
<p>
Each breakpoint is associated with an id (printed when the breakpoint
is set or by the <b>list-breakpoints</b> command) which is used
for further references to the breakpoint.
<p>
For convenience there are also a <b>break</b> command which sets a
breakpoint on memory connected to the current frontend CPU (see
<b>pselect</b>). Default is to break on virtual address accesses
(in the current context). By prefixing the address with <i>p:</i>
it is possible to break on physical accesses as well (cf.
<b>phys_mem0.break</b>); e.g., <b>break p:0xffc0</b>.
<p>
Several attributes can be set for a breakpoint for breaking only when
some conditions are true. See the <b>disable</b>,
<b>enable</b>, <b>ignore</b>, <b>set-prefix</b>,
<b>set-substr</b> and <b>set-pattern</b> commands for more
details.
<p>
Breakpoints can be removed using <b>delete</b>.</dd>
